            Hey there curious reader, my name is William Jordan Waller but since that is such a mouthful you can just call me Jordan like everyone else does. I have a diverse background as far as work goes, I started my first job when I was 16 and while I excelled in performance wherever I went I was never able to find a career for myself in the traditional sense.  I enrolled and was accepted and attended UCF in fall of 2008 but again I quickly found myself wanting more and was able to concentrate my focus on just one major.  I am currently working for JP Morgan Chase as a Business Analyst and once again I have started to experience the desire for advancement as far as my skill set goes.  I began the journey of coding with the help of a close friend and mentor and soon found the challenge and excitement of the endeavor to be the thrill I have been looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
            UCF Coding Bootcamp has been everything I had hope for thus far and I find myself waiting and yearning to return to the classroom to further my education.  This opportunity couldn't have come at a better moment in my life and it has shown me while in the past I was lost it was all leading me to this moment.  My instructor is funny and brilliant, my TA's are helpful and patient and my classmates seem to be just as eager to learn as I am.  I know I am where I was always meant to be, and I'm going to destroy this challenge and become the person I have always wanted to be.  Time is precious, and you might feel you are wasting your time doing something but take it from it every experience is a lesson waiting to be taught you just have to open yourself up to the endless possibilities life puts on your path.
